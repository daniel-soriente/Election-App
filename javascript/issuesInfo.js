With the government having lost control of Australia's northern border, Rudd introduced the hardline PNG Solution soon after ascending to the top job again. Rudd declared no asylum seeker who comes by boat would ever be resettled in Australia. They will instead be sent to Papua New Guinea and Nauru for processing and, if found to be refugees, will be resettled in PNG or other countries in the region. In exchange for PNG receiving asylum seekers, the Australian government will help fund the redevelopment of the major referral hospital in Lei, its long-term management needs and half the cost of reforming PNG's university sector. Australia will also pay for the costs of the agreement, including the processing of asylum seekers' refugee claims, and their housing and care. Labor last year increased Australia's annual humanitarian intake to 20,000 places a year and flagged lifting it again.";
a[1] = "Under 'Operation Sovereign Borders', the Coalition would, in the first 100 days, create a joint agency taskforce comprising more than 12 government agencies led by a three-star general, finalise plans to turn back boats 'where it is safe to do so', increase capacity at offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru, and lease and deploy additional vessels to intercept boats. A Coalition government would reintroduce temporary protection visas and extend them, meaning no one who came to Australia by boat would ever get permanent resettlement; they would have to reapply for protection periodically and return to their home country once it was safe. It would make its temporary protection visas retrospective, meaning no asylum seeker who has already arrived in Australia would ever have permanent settlement. It would deny asylum seekers access to challenge negative refugee determinations. It would introduce mandatory police notifications when asylum seekers moved into the community. The Coalition would also allocate $20 million to 'buy back' boats from fisherman in Indonesia, where there are some 750,000 vessels It would also reduce the humanitarian intake of refugees to 13,750, from the government's expanded 20,000 places.";
a[2] = "The Greens would strip all deterrents from refugee policy and aim to stop deaths at sea by increasing Australia's refugee intake to 30,000 and boosting the capacity of the United Nations refugee agency to process claims in Indonesia. The policy will cost $2.5billion over four years, a fraction of the amount spent on offshore processing. But the Greens would have, in effect, no limit on the number of boat people who arrive here, right at a time when Australia is already on track to receive more than 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals this year.";

e[0] = "The government believes it has a good story to tell on education, with its school funding reforms set to deliver up to $15 billion extra over the next six years - but the majority of extra money is not due until the final two years. Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have not signed up. Base funding for each student will be topped up by 'loadings' based on disadvantage. Indexation rates for annual increases are fixed, unlike the previous Howard-era model, where they fluctuated each year. Labor argues the legislated plan is transformative and includes other measures to improve teacher quality and increase school autonomy without handing over too much control. Labor says unlike the Coalition, its plan ensures state government spending on schools must also increase. It has pledged funding for better outside school hours care and more trade training centres. Recent budget savings targeting universities and student support undercut Labor's education message but it may backtrack.";
e[1] = "After repeatedly denying the school funding system was broken and questioning the government's plan, the federal Coalition announced on the eve of the election it would match Labor's budget allocations. The catch is that this applies for the four-year budget cycle, not the full six years of Labor's plan - and the majority of extra funding was earmarked in the final years. The Coalition will seek to change the school funding legislation to strip away what it labels the 'command and control' features imposed by Labor, watering down obligations on state and territory governments and the non-government sector. The Coalition also wants to encourage about 1500 existing state schools, or about a quarter, to become 'independent public schools' by 2017, thereby gaining more control over their budgeting and staffing. The Coalition has vowed to focus on teacher quality, review the national curriculum and consider stopping NAPLAN results from being published on the My School website.";
e[2] = "The Greens are strong supporters of the school funding reforms, based on the David Gonski-led expert panel, but complain the extra money will trickle in too slowly. The Greens have vowed to fund 2235 new teachers in disadvantaged government schools at a cost of $163 million per year. The party has called for the reversal of university cuts and want to inject even more money into higher education, calling for a staged 10 per cent increase costing nearly $1.5 billion over four years.";

b[0] = "One of Labor's signature policies since 2007 is to connect almost all Australians to superfast broadband - the biggest infrastructure project in Australian history. Under Labor's $37.4 billion national broadband network, 93 per cent of Australians will get the fastest internet technology available. This involves running fibre optic cables to the front doors of homes and businesses across the country. The remaining 7 per cent of Australians who live in rural and regional areas will get fixed satellite and wireless, which offer speeds similar to the fastest ADSL plans currently on the market. Labor's NBN has rolled out much slower than originally planned with NBN Co regularly lowering its forecasts. There have been recent obstacles with asbestos found in Telstra pits; and with contract negotiations stalling as construction companies claim they are losing money on their NBN work. The NBN has long been one of Labor's most popular policies. According to national polling, more than 70 per cent of Australians support the NBN. Labor has sought to exploit this during the election campaign by advertising its technological superiority to 'Abbott's Internet'.";
b[1] = "The Coalition has come a long way since 2010, when it offered no substantial broadband policy. When the Opposition Leader Tony Abbott appointed Malcolm Turnbull to be his communications spokesman in 2010, Mr Abbott's original advice was to 'demolish' Labor's NBN. Since then, many senior Coalition ministers have recognised that their failure on broadband policy contributed to their loss at the last election, and the party's policy now is to support a cheaper version of Labor's network. The Coalition estimates its alternative NBN will cost about $17 billion less than Labor's and Mr Turnbull says it will be completed two years sooner (in 2019 versus 2021). Instead of running fibre all the way to homes, Mr Turnbull wants to rely more heavily on running fibre to cabinets on street corners then switch to the aging copper telephone lines for the final leg of the journey. The Coalition's NBN will be slower than Labor's, and many have criticised it as a short-term solution and queried the longevity of the copper network it relies on. Mr Turnbull promises maximum speeds of about 100 megabits per second versus the one gigabit speeds possible under Labor's NBN.";
b[2] = "The Greens Party support the principle of superfast broadband for almost all Australians, but the Greens do not accept the Coalition's argument that the network should be built sooner and at less cost than Labor's. The Greens endorse Labor's more expensive, fibre-to-the-home version of the NBN, believing it is better to build it once and build it right. The party claims in its policy document that if Opposition Leader Tony Abbott becomes prime minister he will put the NBN 'at risk' by relying on aging copper telephone lines to transmit data over the 'final leg' from street corners to homes.";

m[0] = "Labor would introduce a bill to legalise same sex marriage within 100 days of taking office. Kevin Rudd last year voted against Labor backbencher Stephen Jones' private member's bill to legalise same-sex marriage, but in May announced that he had changed his mind after a conversation with a gay former staffer. Rudd has described himself as the first Australian prime minister to be a 'fully signed-up supporter of marriage equality'. While Labor's platform supports same-sex marriage, Labor MPs have a free vote. Rudd has challenged Tony Abbott to allow Coalition MPs to vote according to their consciences, and said if they were not given a free vote, he would consider other mechanisms for change, such as a plebiscite or a referendum. This idea is unpopular with same-sex marriage campaigners, who fear a referendum campaign would be divisive. But advocates believe Rudd's position will embolden more Labor MPs to support change.";
m[1] = "Tony Abbott opposes gay marriage and bound his MPs to his position, arguing that to allow a free vote would break faith with voters after the coalition went to the 2010 election with a policy of marriage being between a man and a woman. But he said in April the coalition party room would determine the party's position after the election, opening the door to a possible conscience vote during the next parliament. He has since doused expectations of any change on the issue in the next Parliament, predicting that a significant majority of Coalition MPs will share his strong opposition to gay marriage.'I don't think anyone should expect that this is necessarily going to come up in the next parliament,' Mr Abbott said. Liberal MPs including Malcolm Turnbull, Simon Birmingham and Dean Smith have called for a free vote.";
m[2] = "The Greens want 'the legalisation of marriage between two consenting adults regardless of sex, sexuality or gender identity.' The party has introduced legislation to allow this. 'It's an issue of basic fairness,' the party says on its website. 'Who you love is more important than an outdated law.' The party also introduced proposals which would have seen Australia recognise same-sex marriages performed overseas, but these were defeated in parliament. The Greens oppose holding a referendum on the issue. Spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young has accused Kevin Rudd of 'squibbing the leadership on marriage equality,' and has suggested Labor MPs should be required to vote in accordance with the party platform, which supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage.";
